            <p class="NewTitle"> THE BIGGEST 2023 HOME DÉCOR TRENDS</p>
        </div>

    <div class="uvodniText">
        <p>  Interest in interior design is, inarguably, booming. Talk of trends in the home realm isn't just happening annually around the design fair circuit, monthly in magazines, or daily on websites anymore. Now it’s literally moment by moment on social media, on Instagram, on Tik Tok, and more.
            <br><br><br>
            So let’s take a step back from the near-constant buzz of what’s in and what’s out to gain a little perspective. Instead of playing into the machine that seeks to make your every decision (and purchase) fodder for self-doubt, we’re more interested in the cultural, artistic, and creative worlds that lead us, collectively, to seek out spaces, furniture, artisan pieces and artful items that feel like the appropriate response to this particular moment in time.
            <br><br><br>
            How did we get here, what led us to the 7 “trends” that will doubtlessly make interiors in 2023, or as they say on Tik Tok, a vibe? Athena Calderone, Tiffany Thompson, Christiane Lemieux, Charlotte Taylor, Pieter Paulen, and Augusta Hoffman weigh in. </p>

            <p class="naslov">MADE OF STEEL</p>
            <p class="pText1"> We’ve been swathed in a warm expanse of bronze, gold, and copper hues for so long that cool, cold silver metals can almost feel like an act of rebellion. “Stainless steel is an unexpected material I am seeing frequently lately,” Athena notes. “For so long the focus was on blackened steel, brass, or copper but I’m definitely starting to see more stainless and pewter. Actually, pewter is the gateway for me to get on board the stainless trend again.” While the option to go full '80s-inspired stainless steel kitchen is always on the cards, we love the idea of easing in with cool, sculptural metal accessories.

    <div class="drugiDiv">
        <p class="naslov">PAPER & FABRIC LIGHTING</p>
        <p class="textTreci">The best of design almost always strikes a balance between hard and soft, straight and curved, bold and subdued. One fresh way to integrate an ethereal quality into a space is lighting fashioned from draped, sheer, or soft materials such as paper, fabric, or silk. Athena notes: “I went to Mexico City last year and I visited several of Luis Barragán’s projects. He was incredibly religious so there was a space or table in every room of his private home that was draped in fabric and doubled as an altar. A couple of months later I went to Venice and noticed the same draping of fabric on the altar in so many of the ancient churches. It was incredibly beautiful. There is something so moving about seeing glass elements that are cold and slick counterbalanced by this soft lighting draped in fabric, silk, or paper.” The options for this look run the gamut from the O.G. Isamu Noguchi or new takes found in designs by White Dirt Studio or Ingo Maurer.</p>

            <p class="naslov">LET'S CALL IT MODERN FANCY</p>
            <p class="pText2"> To put it succinctly, “I’m calling the new look modern fancy,” Christiane Lemieux says. “People are craving personality. Marble is being replaced by warm woods, warmth in terms of color palette, warm grays, taupe, sand, and khaki. Colors like ox blood and red that were out of style are coming back. No more Instagram minimalism, [now it’s about] French 40s art nouveau, a beautiful level of embellishment, not too much.” It’s one of those moments that live in the you-know-it-when-you-see-it-realms. Of course, it can be found in Christie’s-level auction house pieces, but it can just as easily live at your local estate sale on a very special, unmarked piece that just happens to catch your eye.
