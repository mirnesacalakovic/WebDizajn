        <br> — OLIVER GUSTAV, live beautiful</p>
    <div class="uvodniText">
        <p">Amass what moves you. The directive is simple enough, but it's the sentiment behind this approach that's powerful. Read: surround yourself only with objects that make you feel something. That is the goal, always. Especially when it comes to the quandary of how to how to style a bookshelf. There are myriad ways to tackle them, and while we're sharing a few of those with you today, the key to landing that final look is already within you.
            <br><br><br>
            
            Hand select that which excites and intrigues your eye, objects both humble and sophisticated that span time and place. Pieces you collect, regardless of time period or style, drive narrative, emotion, and history in an interior. They stand on their own, and in unison, they tell a personal story about themselves, and about you, imploring conversation and yes, as the title suggests, visual intrigue. Follow this cardinal design rule and you'll never be led astray.
 
            <br><br><br>
            In summation, bookshelves should be like curiosity cabinets—filled with books and objects that hold sentimental value. That means ditching the do’s and don’ts when it doesn’t suit your vision. The eye knows what the eye wants, so trust it! If you get overwhelmed, step back and take a photo to assess it as an entire tableau, then rearrange, restyle, and above all, play!

            <p class="naslov">Center of ATTENTION</p>
            <p class="pText1"> Consider layering aesthetic periods and styles to create an enticing visual mix but don't forget to create a focal point. The vision you've set for your shelves can easily get lost without an anchor. This could take shape in the form of an abstract sculpture or sentimental object that sets the tone for the arrangement and beckons the eye.

            <p class="naslov">COME Together</p>
            <p class="pText3 T1">We always recommend mixing and matching design styles but it can quickly lean toward chaos versus cohesion. The solve? A controlled palette. Keeping everything within the same hue family gently melds the opposing forms and eras together so they feel unified. Our preference is a neutral base so you can pepper in color or pattern without disrupting the overall look and feel of the display.</p>

        <div class="prviText">
            <p class="naslov">VERTICALITY Is Key</p>
            <p class="pText3">Create multiple vignettes of varying heights and shapes to see what sticks; stack books in uneven parallel and perpendicular lines; orient each shelf differently from the one adjacent to it, and add something offbeat to create the visual interest your eye craves. The goal is to entice the viewer's attention so it moves about the bookshelf, drawing it in for a closer look. </p>

        <p class="naslov">Find the PROFOUND in the Practical</p>
        <p class="textTreci">Yes, a bookshelf serves a purpose—to store your beloved tomes for easy retrieval when you want to bury your nose in them. But they’re also an opportunity to create a stylish space you want to hang out in. Who doesn’t love the idea of sitting in a comfortable lounge chair, a cup of steaming coffee on the side table, and a pile of books on the other, all while the scent of paperbacks fills the air? Our idea of heaven. So, in the same way we approach every other area of the home, it’s important to inject decorative objects into your functional spaces. Mirrors, vessels, sculptures, and art can and should live within your bookshelves.</p>

            <p class="naslov n2">STRESS Over the Small Stuff</p>
            <p class="pText2">In life, the opposite of this statement is true but in design, the devil is in the details. Collect treasures, stones, twigs, obscurities, and curios that set your bookshelf arrangement apart. There is beauty in the personal and the lived-in versus new and modern. It doesn't have to be expensive either, just needs to speak to you in some way. By assembling the small, sentimental pieces together, the overall arrangement takes on a new meaning, and the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts.
                <br><br><br><br>
                In closing, we'd love to share a quote from Live Beautiful by Danish architect and designer, Signe Bindslev Henriksen: "I don't see a project as finished, but rather in constant movement." This is how we approach everything in life but especially in design. Your bookshelves are never complete—they are constantly evolving as you do, morphing and changing in accordance with your tastes, travels, and lifestyle. Happy shelf styling!</p>
