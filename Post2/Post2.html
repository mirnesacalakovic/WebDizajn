    <p class="quote">“I’M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT FUNCTION AS I’M DESIGNING
        —HOW TO PROBLEM-SOLVE FOR THOSE 
        UTILITARIAN AREAS WITHOUT COMPROMISING AESTHETICS.”<br> — Athena Calderone</p>
    <div class="uvodniText">
        <p>  While we wholeheartedly concur, this philosophy isn’t always easy to apply—especially when it comes to basement design. This is a space that needs to be super multifunctional and oftentimes those shelves, racks, and storage bins aren’t always pretty. But if anyone can do it, it’s Athena, and of course, she found a way to balance the inspired with the mundane in her Amagansett basement design.
            <br><br><br>
            Knowing she needed a laundry room but also a kitchen for any overflow from the refrigerator upstairs (especially when hosting friends or an event), along with storage for all of her excess beach blankets, towels, and bedding, Athena designed the main room of the basement to serve all three. “I wanted the washer/dryer design to look and feel like a kitchen but function as a laundry,” she outlines. “So the whole side wall next to the fridge is really just doors that are painted in the same color as the kitchen to open up the space.” Instead of paying for custom closets, she added wire shelving inside the “kitchen” cabinets for storage, too.
            <br><br><br>
            Keep reading to discover more of Athena’s problem-solving design hacks to create a well-functioning basement that doesn’t leave your taste at the door.  </p>

            <p class="naslov">Beauty & Utility, Always</p>
            <p class="pText1"> Most basements need a dehumidifier to combat moisture. Athena wanted to find a way to stash hers away when not in use, so she put their matte black dehumidifier on wheels. “Now, I just store it in the closet and roll it out when I need it to capture all the water,” she says, “I definitely prefer to have it tucked away when we’re hosting guests down there.” She also needed a place to dry their clothes but didn’t want drying racks to be left out all the time. Enter collapsible dryer racks that can be stored in the same closet as the humidifier.

            <p class="naslov">Curtain Call</p>
            <p class="pText3 T1">There are always unsightly areas of a basement but that doesn’t mean they should always be in view. Athena wanted to separate the beautiful design of the front area from the workable, utilitarian section at the back—aka the guts! “There was one passageway in between those two spaces where all of the mechanics lived,” she explains. “So I purchased a curtain rack from Wayfair that attaches to the ceiling and runs the whole span of that space, thus elegantly hiding all of the mechanics. I couldn’t build a wall there because you need to access the space, so this was a simple and cost-effective aesthetic solution.”</p>

        <div class="prviText">
            <p class="naslov">Bare Necessities</p>
            <p class="pText3">On the other side of the passageway (behind the curtain) is the storage room. We bought ample wire shelving where she stacks large, medium, and small storage containers to hold clothing and personal items she wants to store. Adjacent to that are the surfboard rack, bike rack, and guts of the basement. “It might not be highly designed but it does need to be well organized.” </p>

    <div class="drugiDiv">
        <p class="naslov">Stylish SOLUTION</p>
        <p class="textTreci">There is always a lot of ductwork when designing a basement but Athena never wants to sacrifice losing height. To avoid weirdly shaped boxes when anything dips down, Athena took a clever design approach by keeping them all contained in one rectilinear box. “This creates a new ceiling plane that can be flat in one area instead of all these different bump-outs,” she explains. “You want to avoid drawing the eye to unsightly areas, and instead, focus on the beauty,” she says. We couldn’t agree more.</p>
